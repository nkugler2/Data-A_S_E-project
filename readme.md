# My Data A_S_E Project - SEC Financial Data

This project is to help me experience the entire data pipeline, from intial extraction of data, to data engineering for analytics, through the analytics, and ending at data science. 

I am using data that is submitted to the SEC to really test myself on not only the data pipeline, but also finanical data including income statements, balance sheets, and the like. My goal is to build a data pipeline where I can do analytics and data science modeling to understand the companies who's data is available, and see the entire proces of organizing data. 

I would like to:
1. Ingest data from the [SEC Site](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/financial-statement-data-sets) and place it in a bronze zone
2. Transform that data in the silver zone for analytics and modeling
3. Create a gold zone of data ready for analytics
4. Begin with simple extraction of historical data, and then later utilize the API to update data with up-to-date information
5. Reconsturct financial statements per company using code
6. Collect, analyze, and visualize data for groups of companies or specific industries
7. Perform trend analysis to see how companie's finances change over time
8. Create visualizations and spreadsheets that can compare different years of one company or multiple companies
9. Create models that can understand or predict financial performance
10. (Stretch) Possibly integrate outside data to augment the SEC data
11. (Stretch) Possibly use sentiment analysis of news reports and combine that with financial data to understand/predict financial performance.
